### Deleting an Exam Score : `deleteScore`

Deletes a specified person's exam score.

**Format:** `deleteScore INDEX`

<box type="info" seamless>

**Information:**

* Deletes the exam score of the person at the specific `INDEX`.
* A person **must** have an exam score for the currently selected exam for this command to work.
* The exam score deleted corresponds to the currently selected exam.

</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Important:**

An exam must be selected for this command to work! You can use the [`selectExam`](#selecting-an-exam--selectexam) command to do so.

</box>

**Example:** `deleteScore 1` <br>
deletes the score of the person currently displayed at index 1.

You will see this message once you have successfully deleted a score, including some details of the person you added the score for:

<div id="mean-and-median"></div>

### Mean and Median of Exam Scores

You can view the mean and median of the scores of the exam currently selected at the bottom right of the application window.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Information:**

* When an exam is selected, the mean and median will automatically show up on the right of the footer of the application.
* The mean and median is calculated based on the currently filtered list of persons.
* If a person has no score for the selected exam, he is completely excluded from the calculation of mean and median.

</box>

When an exam is selected, the statistics will show on the bottom right of the application:

## Additional Information

### Saving the Data

All data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the Data File

All data are saved automatically as a JSON file located at `[JAR file location]/data/avengersassemble.json` by default. You can update data directly by editing that data file if you are an advanced user.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**

If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Avengers Assemble will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br/>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the Avengers Assemble application to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

<div id="faq"></div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AA home folder.

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div id="known-issues"></div>

## Known Issues

### Using Multiple Screens

If you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

### Importing on MacOS

On MacOS computers, due to privacy settings, the application may encounter difficulties accessing and importing CSV files from various locations.
If this issue occurs, transfer the CSV file you want to import to the same folder where the application's JAR file is located, then try again.

### Exporting Data on Initial Launch

Since the `export` function relies on data stored in your computer's hard disk, there might be some issues exporting it during the first launch of the application.
If you encounter this problem, you can resolve it by executing any other command (such as `list`) and then attempting the export again.

## Command Parameter Summary

Some commands require you to include parameters. These parameters are identified by prefixes. Here are a list of valid prefixes and what they each refer to.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Important:** </br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
    > e.g. in `add n|NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n|John Doe`.

* Prefixes encased with '[ ]' are optional.
    > e.g. `n|NAME [t|TAG]` can be used as `n|John Doe t|friend` or as `n|John Doe`.

* Prefixes with '…' after them can be used multiple times.
    > e.g. `[t|TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t|friend` (i.e 1 time), `t|friend t|family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
    > e.g. if the command specifies `n|NAME p|PHONE_NUMBER`, `p|PHONE_NUMBER n|NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help` , `list`, `exit`, `copy`, `export` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
    > e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</box>

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:** </br>
* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
* Note the same prefix may be used for different purposes such as in the case of `s|` for studios and for scores. In these cases, we ensure no command would have to use the same prefix for multiple purposes.

### Architecture

<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" /></p>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" /></p>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.)

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" /></p>

The sections below give more details of each component.

<br>

<div id="ui-component"></div>

### UI Component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/></p>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `CommandBox` takes in user input which is passed onto the `Logic` component for the user input to be parsed and executed. A `CommandResult` is returned after execution and the feedback is displayed to the user through the `ResultDisplay` component of the UI.

For the updating of other components in the UI, after each command execution, `MainWindow` runs an update that calls the update method on `PersonListPanel`, `ExamListPanel` and `StatusBarFooter`.

`PersonListPanel` and `ExamListPanel` update themselves by retrieving the `filteredPersonList` and `examList` from the `Model` component and updating the displayed lists accordingly.

`StatusBarFooter` contains the mean and median feature, and it updates itself by retrieving `ScoreStatistics`
from the `Model` on update.

In summary, the `UI` component:

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* checks for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as the `UI` updates based on items that are stored in `Model`

The sequence diagram below illustrates a more in-depth view of the interactions within the UI component

<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/UiSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Sequence Diagram of UI Component"/></p>

#### Considerations For UI

##### Dynamic UI Updates

The UI is designed to update dynamically based on changes in the `Model`. We narrowed down to two design choices for updating the UI components. They are:

1. **Update using listeners embedded into UI components** - This design choice would involve embedding listeners into the UI components that would listen for changes in the `Model` (e.g. adding a listener to filteredPersons in ExamListPanel). This would allow for a more loosely coupled system, but would involve more complex implementation which could get messy as the number of listeners increase.
2. **Update using a centralized update method** - This design choice involves having a centralized `update` method in the `MainWindow` that would call an `update` method in all other UI components after every command. This would involve a more tightly coupled system and may involve unnecessary updates, but would be easier to implement and maintain.

We chose the second design choice as having a centralized update method would allow for easier maintenance, as there is a clear indicator of how UI components are updated from `MainWindow`. Adding extensions would also be more straightforward as future developers would know where to look for the update logic.

With listeners, the update logic would be scattered across multiple UI component classes, making it much harder to search and add upon the update logic.

One of our main goals was to make our codebase easy to understand and maintain, and we felt that the centralized update method would be more in line with this goal despite the slight increase in coupling and inefficiency.

### Logic Component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/></p>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/></p>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`)
* The `XYZCommandParser` [uses the other classes](#specificParsing) shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<br>

#### Example of Parsing User Input: `delete` Command

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking a simple `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" /></p>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

The following is a more detailed explanation on how user input is parsed into a `Command` object (not mentioned above for simplicity).

##### Using Argument Tokenizer and Argument Multimap
* After the `XYZCommandParser` is instantiated by the `AddressBookParser`, it uses the `ArgumentTokenizer` class to tokenize the user input string into the arguments.
  * This is done through the `tokenize` method which returns an `ArgumentMultimap` object.
* The `ArgumentMultimap` class is then used to extract the relevant arguments.

<br>

**Mandatory Arguments and Multiple Arguments**

* For some commands, some arguments are mandatory and the `arePrefixesPresent` method is used to check if the arguments (i.e the corresponding prefixes) are present in the user input. If not, an exception is thrown.
* For some commands, multiple arguments under the same category (e.g. two name arguments for an AddCommand) are not allowed. The `ArgumentMultimap` class is used to check for undesirable multiple arguments using the `verifyNoDuplicatePrefixesFor` method. If multiple arguments are present, an exception is thrown.

<br>

**Validation of Arguments**

* Validation of each extracted argument is done using the methods defined in the `ParserUtil` class. This class contains methods to validate different arguments extracted by the `ArgumentMultimap` class based on the `VALIDATION_REGEX` defined in component classes (`Name.java`, `Score.java`, etc.).
* The parsed arguments are then used to create a `XYZCommand` object to be executed.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** Some commands do not require any arguments (e.g., `help`, `clear`, `list`, `exit`). In such cases, the `XYZCommand` class is directly instantiated by the `AddressBookParser` class without the parsing of arguments. As such, any arguments passed to these commands are ignored.

</box>

#### Considerations for Logic

The `Logic` component is designed to be the central component that executes all user commands. This design choice was made to ensure that all commands are executed in a consistent manner, and to prevent the duplication of command execution logic across different components. By centralizing the command execution logic in the `Logic` component, we ensure that all commands are executed in the same way, regardless of the component that initiates the command execution. This design choice also allows for easier maintenance and extensibility, as any changes to the command execution logic can be made in a single location.

<br>

<div id="model-component"></div>

### Model Component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" /></p>


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and all `Exam` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueExamList` object).
* stores the currently filtered `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI can update when the data in the list changes.
* stores the currently selected `Exam` which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableValue<Exam>`. This is used in conjunction with the exam and exam score implementation, and also used to update the highlighted exam on the UI.
* stores `ScoreStatistics` for the currently selected `Exam`. This statistic is used in conjunction with the mean and median feature. It is also exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableValue<ScoreStatistics>` so that the UI can be bound to this value for updating.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below relating to the `Person` class. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br> However, we opted not to use this model. As much as possible, we tried to keep the attributes of `Person` unlinked to other classes to prevent complications in our saving, import and export functionalities.

<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" /></p>

</box>

<br>

<div id="storage-component"></div>

### Storage Component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" /></p>

<br>
<br>

#### Saving of Data

The `Storage` component uses the `Jackson` library to convert objects to JSON format. The conversion methods are predefined in the `JsonAdapted` classes for their corresponding objects.

The `Logic` class stores a `StorageManager` object that implements the methods in the `Storage` class. For **every** command that is executed, `Logic` uses `StorageManager` to save the updated `AddressBook` through the `saveAddressBook` method.

The `StorageManager` class calls on the `JsonAddressBookStorage` class to convert all objects in the `AddressBook` to JSON formatting. The converted JSON objects are consolidated in the `JsonSerializableAddressBook` class and it is seraliazed to JSON format and saved using the `saveJsonToFile` method.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how data is saved within the `Storage` component when the user issues a command.

<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/StorageSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Sequence Diagram for the `Storage` Component" /></p>

<br>
<br>

#### Loading of Data

When the application is initialised, the `Storage` component reads the JSON objects from the save file and converts them back to objects that can be used to initialise the `Model` component. This is done using the `readJsonFile` method of the `JsonUtil` class which utilises the methods defined in the `JsonAdapted` classes to convert the saved JSON data back to objects that can be used by the `Model` component.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how data is loaded within the `Storage` component when the application is initialised.

<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/StorageLoadSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Sequence Diagram for the `Storage` Component" /></p>


In summary, the `Storage` component:
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

<br>

### Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.
These classes provide utility functions that are used across different components such as
`CollectionUtil`, `StringUtil`, `JsonUtil` etc. It also contains app wide constants and exceptions.

<div id="implementation"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented

<div id="general features"></div>

### General Features

As these general features do not require any arguments, the `AddressBookParser` directly instantiates the corresponding command classes.

<div id ="help"></div>

#### **Help Command** : `help`

The `help` command utilizes the `java.awt.Toolkit` class to copy the user guide link to the user's clipboard.

##### Executing the Command

On execution of the `HelpCommand`, the `copyToClipboard` method is called which retrieves the system clipboard
through `Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getSystemClipboard()` and copies the user guide link to the clipboard by using
`setContents` method.

##### Design Considerations

We designed the help command to copy the user guide link directly to the clipboard as we wanted our application to be
CLI optimised. This allows our target users to easily access the user guide without having to use their mouse
to navigate to the user guide link.

<div id="clear"></div>

#### **Clear Command** : `clear`

The `clear` command allows users to clear all persons and exams from the persons and exams list.

##### Executing the Command

The `ClearCommand` simply sets the `AddressBook` in the `Model` component to a new `AddressBook` object, effectively clearing all persons and exams from the persons and exams list.

##### Design Considerations

We designed the `clear` command to clear all persons and exams from their respective lists to provide users with a quick and easy way to reset the application to its initial state. This is useful for users who want to start over or clear the application for a fresh start.

<div id="list"></div>

#### **List Command** : `list`

The `list` command allows users to list all persons in the persons list.

##### Executing the Command

The `ListCommand` retrieves the `filteredPersonList` from the `Model` component and returns a `CommandResult` object containing the list of persons to be displayed on the UI.

##### Design Considerations

We designed the `list` command to list all persons in the persons list to provide users with a quick and easy way to view all persons in the persons list. This is useful to revert the UI back to the default view after a find command has been executed which filters the persons displayed on the UI.

<div id="contact-management"></div>

### Contact Management Features

All contacts are stored as `Person` objects in the `UniquePersonList` object under the `AddressBook` of the `Model` component.
There is an additional `filteredPersons` list stored in the `Model` component that stores the persons currently displayed in the `PersonListPanel` on the UI. This list is updated whenever the user issues a command that might change the persons displayed in the `PersonListPanel`.

<div id="add-person"></div>

#### **Add Person Command** : `add`

The `add` command allows users to add a person to the persons list.

The user can specify the person's:
* name (`Name`),
* phone number (`Phone`),
* address (`Address`),
* email (`Email`),

and optionally provide additional information such as their:
* matriculation number (`Matric`),
* reflection (`Reflection`),
* studio (`Studio`),
* and tags (`Tag`).

<br>

##### Parsing User Input
The `AddCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing user input to extract the details of the person to be added. It uses the `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize the input string, extracting prefixes and their associated values. It ensures that all mandatory fields are present and that there are no duplicate prefixes in the user input.

##### Executing the Command
The `AddCommand` class creates a new `Person` object with the parsed details.
The `Person` object is then added to the `UniquePersonList` through the `addPerson` method in the `Model` component.

##### Sequence Diagram

The sequence diagram below illustrates a more in-depth view of the interactions regarding the parsing of user input.
It takes an add command: `execute(add n|Dohn Joe p|98765432 a|123 e|dohn@gm.com m|A1234567X s|S1 r|R1)` as an example.

<br>
<br>

##### Design Considerations

**Use of `Email` Field as Unique Identifier** <br>

We have chosen to use the `Email` field as a unique identifier. Due to the real-world implementation of email addresses, and specifically in NUS, email addresses are unique to each person. This allows for easy identification of persons and prevents the creation of duplicate persons with the same email address.

This is opposed to using the `Name` field as a unique identifier, as an app with our proposed scale will likely be handling a large number of persons potentially having the same name. This would make it difficult to identify or keep track of persons with the same name.

**Compulsory and Non-compulsory Fields** <br>

We have chosen to make the following fields compulsory as they are essentials and most likely available to the head TA:
* `Name`
* `Email`
* `Phone`
* `Address`

The following fields are optional as they may not be available for all persons:
* `Matric`
* `Reflection`
* `Studio`
* `Tag`

<br>

<div id="edit-person"></div>

#### **Edit Person Command** : `edit`

The `edit` command allows a user to edit the details of an existing person.

##### Parsing User Input

The `EditCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing user input to extract the index of the person to be edited and the new details of the person.
It uses the `ArgumentTokenizer` class to tokenize the user input string, extracting the index of the person to be edited and the new details of the person. It ensures that the index is valid and that there are no duplicate prefixes in the user input.

##### Executing the Command

The `EditCommand` first retrieves the person to be edited from the `Model` component.
This is done by first retrieving the `filteredPersonList` from the `Model` component using the `getFilteredPersonList` method
The person to be edited is then retrieved from the `filteredPersonList` using the index provided by the user.
The `EditCommand` then creates a new `Person` object with the new details provided by the user and the selected person's existing details. The `Person` object is then updated in the `UniquePersonList` through the `setPerson` method in the `Model` component.

##### Activity Diagram

The activity diagram below illustrates the workflow involved in executing the `edit` command. In practice, a `Reject` activity will result in a `CommandException` being thrown.

<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/EditCommandActivityDiagram.puml" alt="Activity Diagram for the `edit` Command" /></p>

<br>

<div id="delete-person"></div>

#### **Delete Person Command** : `delete`

The `delete` command allows a user to delete a person with the specified index.

##### Parsing User Input

The `DeleteCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing user input to extract the index of the person to be deleted. It uses the `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize the input string, extracting the index of the person to be deleted and ensuring that the index is valid.

##### Executing the Command

The `DeleteCommand` class first retrieves the person to be deleted from the `Model` component. This is done by first retrieving the `filteredPersonList` from the `Model` component using the `getFilteredPersonList` method. The person to be deleted is then retrieved from the `filteredPersonList` using the index provided by the user. The `DeleteCommand` then deletes the person from the `UniquePersonList` through the `deletePerson` method in the `Model` component.

##### Sequence Diagram

For more details on the implementation of the `delete` command, refer to the [Delete Command Sequence Diagram](#example-of-parsing-user-input-delete-command).

##### Design Considerations

We have chosen to implement the `delete` command to accept the index of the person to be deleted to maximize convenience for the user. The numbering of the lists will be displayed to the user, making indexing very intuitive.

<br>

<div id="find"></div>

#### **Find Command** : `find`

The `find` command lets users search for persons by substring matching. The user can select any parameter to search under:
`NAME`, `EMAIL`, `TAG`, `MATRIC`, `REFLECTION`, `STUDIO`, and `TAGS` can all be used. E.g. to search for all persons under studio `S2`, the user can use `find s|s2`.

The user can also use two other prefixes: `lt` and `mt` to search for persons with scores less than or more than a certain value respectively.
E.g. `find mt|50` will return all persons with scores more than 50.

The `find` feature makes use of the predicate classes `PersonDetailPredicate` and `ExamPredicate`, as well as the method `updateFilteredPersonList`
to update the model to show only persons that fulfill the criteria that the user has keyed in.

##### Parsing User Input

The `FindCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing user input to extract search criteria. It uses the `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize the input string,
extracting prefixes and their associated values. Next, the method `verifyNoDuplicatePrefixesFor` ensures that there are no duplicate prefixes in the user input.
Following that, the `extractPrefixForFindCommand` method ensures that only one valid, non-empty prefix is provided in the input.
After which, the `extractValidKeyword` method ensures that the keyword provided in the input is valid in the case that the prefix is `mt|` or `lt|`,
since these two prefixes specifically require a numerical value as the keyword instead of a string value.

##### Executing the Command

The `FindCommand` class is responsible for executing the command for filtering the list in the application.

Using the prefix and keyword from parsing user input, a `FindCommand` is created. the `execute` method is then called by the `LogicManager`.

**Creating Predicate** <br>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The `PersonDetailPredicate` and `ExamPredicate` classes implement the `Predicate` interface to filter contacts based on the search criteria.
A brief overview of the two classes is given below:
* `PersonDetailPredicate` takes a prefix and keyword as parameters, allowing it to filter contacts based on specific details like name, phone number, etc.
* `ExamPredicate` takes a prefix, a keyword, and an exam as parameters, allowing it to filter contacts based on exam scores of a specific exam.
</box>


The find command first checks if an exam is required by checking if the prefix is `mt|` or `lt|`.
If an exam is required, the `selectedExam` is retrieved from the `model` and passed to the `ExamPredicate` constructor along with the prefix and keyword.
Otherwise, the `PersonDetailPredicate` class is created with the prefix and keyword.

**Updating Filtered Person List** <br>

The `ModelManager` class implements the `Model` interface and manages the application's data. It maintains a `filteredPersons` list,
which is a filtered list of contacts based on the applied predicate. The `updateFilteredPersonList` method implemented in `ModelManager`
updates the filtered list based on the predicate provided.

When the `FindCommand` is executed, the `updateFilteredPersonList` method is called with either the `PersonDetailPredicate` or `ExamPredicate` as a parameter.
This updates the `filteredPersons` list to show only persons that fulfill the conditions set in the `test` method in either of the predicates.

**User Interface Interaction** <br>

After the `filteredPersons` list is updated, the user interface is updated such that the `PersonListPanel` now shows persons that fulfill the predicate generated by the original user input.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the `find` command with the user input `find n|Alice`.
<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/FindImplementationSequenceDiagram.puml" width="1000" /></p>

The next sequence diagram details the creation of the predicate, as well as the updating of the `filteredPersons` list in the `Model` component.

The following activity Diagram illustrates the user execution of the `find` command.
<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/FindImplementationActivityDiagram.puml" width="800" /></p>

The next activity diagram is an expansion of the previous diagram, detailing the case where the user searches for contacts based on exam scores.
<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/FindImplementationFindByScoreActivityDiagram.puml" width="1000" /></p>

##### Design Considerations

**User Interface Consistency** <br>

The choice of implementing the command to use prefixes to determine the filter criteria ensures consistency with other commands in the application.
As this command follows a similar structure to all other commands, it is easier for users to learn and use the application.

**Flexibility in Search Criteria** <br>

By allowing users to specify search criteria using different prefixes (name, phone, email, etc.), the implementation offers flexibility.
Users can search for contacts based on various details, enhancing the usability of the feature.

In the context of our potential users,
we considered that users would likely have to sometimes filter students by their classes, or filter people by their roles (student, tutor, professor).
So we opted to implement this feature with the flexibility of using all prefixes to account for all these potential use cases.

Furthermore, with consideration that our potential users will interact with exam scores, we wanted to integrate the find functionality
to search for contacts based on exam scores. Hence, we decided to introduce the `mt|` and `lt|` prefixes to allow users to search for contacts based on exam scores.

**Two Predicate Classes** <br>

The implementation of two predicate classes, `PersonDetailPredicate` and `ExamPredicate`, allows for a clear separation of concerns.

The `PersonDetailPredicate` class is responsible for filtering contacts based on details like name, phone number, etc.,
while the `ExamPredicate` class is responsible for filtering contacts based on exam scores.

The alternative would be to have a single predicate class that handles all filtering, but this would make this supposed class more complex and harder to maintain.

**Predicate-based Filtering** <br>

As the `Model` class was built prior to the implementation of this feature, we did our best to re-use available methods
instead of unnecessarily reprogramming already existing logic. Hence, we decided to craft the command around the idea of a
custom predicate as the `Model` class already had a `updateFilteredPersonList` method implemented that would filter persons using a predicate.

**Extensibility** <br>

This design allows for easy extension to accommodate future enhancements or additional search criteria.
New prefixes can be added to support additional search criteria without significant changes as we merely need to update our `Predicate` logic.
This ensures that the implementation remains adaptable to evolving requirements and we can upgrade and improve the feature whenever required.

<div id="deleteshown" ></div>

#### **Delete Shown Command** : `deleteShown`

The `deleteShown` command relies on the `filteredPersons` list in the `Model` component to delete the persons currently displayed in the `PersonListPanel`.

##### Executing the Command

The `deleteShown` command first retrieves the `filteredPersons` list from the `Model` component using the `getFilteredPersonList` method. The `deleteShown` command then iterates through the `filteredPersons` list and deletes all currently shown `Persons` from the `UniquePersonList`.

If the currently filtered list does is not showing between 0 and the total number of existing persons, the `deleteShown` command will throw a `CommandException`.

##### Updating Filtered Person List

After deleting all persons currently displayed in the `PersonListPanel`, the `filteredPersons` list in the `Model` component is updated to show all remaining persons in the persons list.

The following activity diagram illustrates the workflow of the execution of the `deleteShown` command:

<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/DeleteShownActivityDiagram.puml" alt="Activity Diagram for the `deleteShown` Command" /></p>

##### Design Considerations

**Reliance on `find` Command** <br>

Similarly to the `copy` command, the `deleteShown` command is designed to be used with the find command, which filters the persons displayed in the `PersonListPanel`. Consequently, the flexibility of the `deleteShown` command relies heavily on the implementation of the `find` command. Due to this dependency, any changes to the `find` command may affect the functionality of the `deleteShown` command.

<br>

<div id="import"></div>

#### **Import Contacts Command** : `import`

The `import` command allows users to import contacts from a CSV file. Users can specify the file path of the CSV file to
import contacts from and with the validation and checking of the CSV rows, person objects can be added to the persons list in the application.

##### Parsing User Input

The `ImportCommandParser` class is responsible for parsing user input to extract the file path of the CSV file to be imported. It uses the `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize the input string, extracting the file path of the CSV file to be imported.

##### Executing the Command

The `ImportCommand` class first makes use `OpenCSV` library which parses the CSV file into a `List<String[]>`, with each `String[]`
representing a row in the CSV file. The `List<String[]>` is further parsed row by row by the `readCsvFile` method, which
returns a `Pair`. The key of the returned `Pair` is a `personsData` list containing the `Person` objects successfully parsed from the CSV file and the value is an error report containing all the errors that occurred during the process of reading from the CSV file.

The `ImportCommand` then iterates through the `personsData` list and adds each `Person` object to the `Model` component
through repeated use of the `AddCommand`. Errors that occur during this process are also added to the error report.

In summary, The import process is done in the following steps:
1. `ImportCommand` reads the CSV file with the given file path.
2. The CSV file is parsed and each row is converted into an `AddCommand`
3. The `AddCommand` is then executed passing the same model as import command.
4. The `AddCommand` then adds the person to the model.

**Handling duplicate persons** <br>

Duplicate records in the imported CSV file is handled by `AddCommand`, which will check if the person already exists in the model. If the person already exists, the `AddCommand` throws a `CommandException` which is caught by the `ImportCommand` and added to an error report.

**Handling invalid CSV files**<br>

Invalid files are handled by `ImportCommand`, with the help of `ImportCommandParser` and `CsvUtil`. `ImportCommandParser` will check if  is a CSV file.
`CsvUtil` will check if the CSV file is valid and will return a list of persons and an error report. The error report will be displayed to the user if there are any errors.

Overall, the conditions checked are:
- The file exists
- The file is a CSV file
- **The first row of the file is the header row**. In which all compulsory fields for creating a persons object
  (ie `name`, `email`, `address`, `phone`)are present. Optional headers will be read if present. Headers in the CSV that are not a field in `Person` will be ignored.

If the file is not valid, an error message will be returned.

**Handling duplicate headers in the CSV file**

Handled by CsvUtil. The first occurrence of the header will be used and the rest will be ignored.

The sequence diagrams below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component when the user issues the command `import`.

<br>
<br>

##### Design Considerations

**Usage of `AddCommand`** <br>

The main concern in the increased coupling between `ImportCommand` and `AddCommand`. However, we established that this coupling was actually a good thing, as the incorporation of the `AddCommand` allowed us to reuse the validation and error handling that was already implemented in the `AddCommand`. Furthermore, should we ever need to change the validation and error handling in the `AddCommand`, the `ImportCommand` would automatically inherit these changes. By making `AddCommand` the gate in which all persons are added to the model, we ensure that all persons added to the model are validated and handled in the same way.

<br>

<div id="copy"></div>

#### **Copy Command** : `copy`

The `copy` command enables users to quickly copy the email addresses of the persons currently displayed to them in the
`PersonListPanel`. The copied emails are stored in the users' clipboard and can be pasted into an email client.
This feature is useful when users need to send emails to a group of persons.

The copy command is a child of the `command` class and relies on the `filteredPersons` list in the `Model` component,
as well as the `java.awt` package to copy the emails of all currently displayed persons to the users' clipboard.

##### Parsing User Input

The `CopyCommand` class is instantiated directly by the `AddressBookParser` class when the user inputs the `copy` command.
This is because the `copy` command does not require any additional arguments from the user.

##### Executing the Command

The `CopyCommand` class is responsible for executing the command for obtaining the emails of the filtered persons and copying them to the clipboard.
It iterates through the `filteredPersons` list in the `Model` component and extracts the email addresses of each person.
The email addresses are then concatenated into a single string, separated by commas, and copied to the clipboard using the `java.awt` package.

**User Interface Interaction** <br>

After the `CopyCommand` is executed, the `UI` component updates the `ResultDisplay` to show a message indicating that the emails have been copied to the clipboard.

The following activity diagram summarizes the steps involved in executing the `copy` command:
<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/CopyImplementationActivityDiagram.puml" width="1000" /></p>

##### Considerations

**Reliance on `find` Command** <br>

The `copy` command is designed to be used with the find command, which filters the persons displayed in the `PersonListPanel`.
Consequently, the flexibility of the `copy` command relies heavily on the implementation of the `find` command.
Due to this dependency, any changes to the `find` command may affect the functionality of the `copy` command.

##### Extensibility

Due to the simplicity of the `copy` command, there are limited opportunities for extending its functionality.
However, future enhancements could include the ability to copy other details of persons, such as phone numbers or addresses.

##### Alternative Implementations

**Alternative 1: Copying emails of all persons**

Copies the emails of all persons in the persons list, regardless of whether they are currently displayed in the `PersonListPanel`.
However, this approach may lead to users copying a large number of emails unintentionally, which could be overwhelming.
Furthermore, it may not be clear to users which emails are being copied.

**Alternative 2: Copying emails into a file**

Instead of copying the emails to the clipboard, the emails could be saved into a file.
This approach would allow users to access the emails at a later time and would prevent the loss of copied emails if the clipboard is cleared.
However, it may be less convenient for users who want to paste the emails directly into an email client.

<br>

<div id="export"></div>

#### **Export Command** : `export`

The `export` command allows users to export the details of each person currently displayed in the `PersonListPanel` to a CSV file. The CSV file is generated in the file `./addressbookdata/avengersassemble.csv`.

The user can first use the `find` feature to filter out the relevant persons, which will be displayed in the `PersonListPanel`.
The `export` feature also relies on the Jackson Dataformat CSV module and the Jackson Databind module to write the details of persons to the CSV file `./addressbookdata/avengersassemble.csv`.

##### Parsing User Input

The `export` command does not require any additional arguments from the user. Hence, an `ExportCommandParser` class is not required.
`AddressBookParser` directly creates an `ExportCommand` object.

##### Executing the Command

**Data Retrieval** <br>
* The `execute` method retrieves the `filteredPersons` list in `Model` by calling the `getFilteredPersonList()` method in `Model`.
  This list stores the relevant persons currently displayed in the `PersonListPanel`.
  It then creates a temporary `AddressBook` object and iterates through the `filteredPersons` list to add each person from the list into the `AddressBook`.
  The data is then written to a JSON file named `filteredaddressbook.json` with the `writeToJsonFile` method in `ExportCommand`.

* The `execute` method also retrieves the address book file path by calling the `getAddressBookFilePath()` method in `Model` (this `AddressBook` stores information of **all** persons and exams).
  This file path is retrieved to obtain information on the examinations added in the application

The sequence diagram illustrates the interactions between the `Logic` and `Model` components when data is being retrieved from `Model` when `export` is executed:

<p align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/ExportDataRetrievalSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Sequence Diagram for Parsing of addScore command" />
</p>

**JSON File Handling** <br>

The contents of both the JSON files retrieved in the above section is read with the `readJsonFile()` method in `ExportCommand` and returned as JSON trees, `filteredJsonTree` and `unfilteredJsonTree`.
This method uses Jackson's `ObjectMapper`.

* From the `filteredJsonTree`, the persons array is extracted using the `readPersonsArray()` method in `ExportCommand` to obtain the filtered persons and their data.
* From the `unfilteredJsonTree`, the exams array is extracted using the `readExamsArray()` method in `ExportCommand` to obtain the exams.

**CSV Conversion** <br>

A CSV file, `avengersassemble.csv`, to write the data to, is created.
Its directory is also created using the `createCsvDirectory()` method in `ExportCommand` if the directory does not exist.
The CSV schema is dynamically built based on the structure of the JSON array using the `buildCsvSchema()` method in `CsvUtil`. This method relies on the Jackson Dataformat CSV module to build the CSV schema.
The CSV schema and JSON data are used to write to the CSV file using Jackson's `CsvMapper`.

The following sequence diagram shows the interactions within the different classes in the JSON file handling section and CSV conversion section when the `export` command is executed:

<p align="center">
  <puml src="diagrams/ExportSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Sequence Diagram for the `export` Command" />
</p>

<br>
<br>

##### Design Considerations

**Obtaining Exam Names from `exams` Array in the Address Book File Path**<br>
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Obtaining exam names from `exams` array in the address book file path.
  * A person in the JSON file will only contain the exam details if they have a score for that exam.
    Therefore, with this choice, if no one in the filtered person's JSON file contains any score for a specific exam, the exam name will still be exported.
  * By adopting this alternative, users will be informed about the existence of an exam even if none of the persons in the filtered list have a score for that exam.
<br><br>
* **Alternative 2:** Obtaining exam names directly from `persons` array in the filtered person's JSON file.
  * This choice will only export an exam if someone in the filtered persons list has a score for that exam.

<br>

**Adding `Exam:` to Exam Names in the CSV Column Headings**<br>
Since users have the flexibility to determine the names of exams added, there's a possibility of adding an exam with the same name as a field (e.g. `reflection`).
This could lead to confusion when mapping the CSV schema and JSON data.
Therefore, appending `Exam:` to the beginning of exam names in the CSV column headings can help mitigate this potential confusion.

<br>

<div id="optional-fields"></div>

#### **Feature: Addition of Optional Fields (Matric)**

The optional `Matric` field enables the user to store the matriculation number of a person. The field is stored as a `Matric` in the `Person` object.

Note: The optional `Studio` and `Reflection` fields are similarly implemented.

##### Implementation Details

The `Matric` class is a simple wrapper class that ensures it is valid according to NUS matriculation number format and is not empty.
The `Matric` field is used by the `add` and `edit` commands.

##### Parsing User Input: `add`

For the `add` command, as opposed to the `name` and other fields, the parser does not check if a prefix for `Matric` is present. This is because we define the `Matric` field to be optional as contacts (e.g. professors) do not need to have a matriculation number.

The parser also verifies that there are no duplicate prefixes for `Matric` in a single `add` command. A new Person is then created with the `Matric` field set to the parsed `Matric` object.

If there is no `Matric` field present, the `Matric` field of the new `Person` object is set to `null`.

##### Parsing User Input: `edit`

For the `edit` command, the parser will add or update the `Matric` field of the person being edited.

<br>

<div id="tagging"></div>

#### **Feature: Automatic Tagging of Persons**

A `student` tag is automatically added during the parsing of the `add` command based on the presence of the `Matric` field of the person being added.

##### Implementation Details

During the parsing of the `add` command, the parser will check if the `Matric` field is present, indicating that they are a student.
The parser also generates `Tag` objects based on the user input. The existing tags are updated with the new automatically generated tag.

The activity diagram is as follows:
<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/AutomaticTaggingActivityDiagram.puml" alt="Activity Diagram for Auto Tagging Feature" /></p>

<div id="exam-management"></div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Exam Features**

There are 4 main commands that are used to interact with the exam feature: `addExam`, `deleteExam`, `selectExam` and `deselectExam`.

All exams are stored in the `UniqueExamList` object in `AddressBook` of the `Model` component. The `Model` component also stores the currently selected exam in the `selectedExam` field.

<br>

<div id="addexam"></div>

#### **Add Exam Command** : `addExam`

The `addExam` command allows users to add an exam to the application.
The user can specify the name of the exam and the maximum score of the exam.
The exam is then added and stored in the `UniqueExamList`.

##### Parsing User Input

The `AddExamCommandParser` is responsible for parsing user input to extract the `name` and the `maxScore` of the exam.
It uses the `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize the input string, extracting `name` and `maxScore`.
It ensures that `name` and `maxScore` are valid and present in the user input, and that there are no duplicate prefixes in the user input.
The `name` and `maxScore` are then used to instantiate an `AddExamCommand`.

##### Executing the Command

The `AddExamCommand` class creates a new `Exam` object with the parsed arguments
It adds the `Exam` to the `UniqueExamList` through the `addExam` method in the `Model` component.
If the exam already exists in the list, a `CommandException` is thrown.

<br>

<div id="deleteexam"></div>

#### **Delete Exam Command** : `deleteExam`

The `deleteExam` command allows users to delete an exam from the application.
The user can specify the index of the exam to be deleted.
The exam is then removed from the `UniqueExamList`.

##### Parsing User Input

The `DeleteExamParser` is responsible for parsing user input to extract the `index` of the exam to be deleted.
It uses the `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize the input string, extracting the `index`.
It ensures that the `index` is valid and present in the user input, and that there are no other prefixes in the user input.
The `index` is used to instantiate a `DeleteExamCommand`.

##### Executing the Command

The `DeleteExamCommand` uses the index to delete the exam from the `UniqueExamList` in the `Model` component.
It first retrieves the `UniqueExamList` by using the `getExamList` method in the `Model` component.
It then retrieves the exam from the `UniqueExamList` using the user provided index.
If the index is greater than the size of the list, a `CommandException` is thrown.
Using the retrieved exam, it then deletes the exam from the `UniqueExamList` through the `deleteExam` method in the `Model` component.

**Execution**

<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/AddExamExecutionSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Sequence Diagram for the execution of `addExam` Command" /></p>

Note: `deleteExam` follows a similar structure, differing in the arguments parsed and the methods called on the `Model` component (e.g. deleting from `UniqueExamList` instead of adding to it).

<br>

<div id="exam-selection"></div>

#### **Select Exam Command** : `selectExam`

The `selectExam` command allows users to select an exam from the `UniqueExamList`.
The selection of exams is heavily used in conjunction with our exam score features.

##### Parsing User Input

The `SelectExamCommandParser` is responsible for parsing user input to extract the `index` of the exam to be selected.
It uses the `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize the input string, extracting the `index`.
It ensures that the `index` is valid and present in the user input, and that there are no other prefixes in the user input.

##### Executing the Command

The `SelectExamCommand` uses the index to select an exam from the `UniqueExamList` in the `Model` component.
It first retrieves the `UniqueExamList` by using the `getExamList` method in the `Model` component.
It then retrieves the exam from the `UniqueExamList` using the user provided index.
If the index is greater than the size of the list, a `CommandException` is thrown.
Using the retrieved exam, it then sets the `selectedExam` field in the `Model` component using the `selectExam` method.

<br>

<div id="exam-deselection"></div>

#### **Deselect Exam Command** : `deselectExam`

The `deselectExam` command allows users to deselect the currently selected exam.

##### Parsing User Input

The `deselectExam` command does not take any arguments from the user.
Hence, a `DeselectExamCommandParser` is not required. `AddressBookParser` directly creates a `DeselectExamCommand` object.

##### Executing the Command

The `DeselectExamCommand` uses the `deselectExam` method in the `Model` component to deselect the currently selected exam.
It sets the `selectedExam` field in the `Model` component to `null`.
If there is no exam selected, a `CommandException` is thrown.

#### **Sequence Diagrams Illustrating Exam Selection**

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions between the Logic and Model when the `SelectExamCommand` is executed.

<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/SelectExamSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Sequence Diagram for the parsing of `selectExam` Command" /></p>

Notes:
- The `ObservableList<Exam>` object is what is returned when retrieving the `UniqueExamList`. This prevents unwanted modifications to the `UniqueExamList` when retrieving the selected exam.
- `deselectExam` follows a similar structure as the diagram above, differing in the arguments parsed and the methods called on the `Model` component (i.e. calling `deselectExam` on `Model` instead of `selectExam`).

<div id="exam-considerations"></div>

#### **Considerations for Exam Features**

##### Using a Selection System for Exams

We decided to implement a selection system for exams to complement the exam score feature. The application would only display the scores of the selected exam, making it easier for users to manage and view the scores.

Our alternative design was to display the scores of all exams at once on every person. However, this alternative design would have made the UI cluttered and less user-friendly. The selection system allows users to focus on the scores of a specific exam, making it easier to view and manage the scores.

##### Using Index for Exam Selection
We were initially torn between the selection of exams using the exam name or the index. We eventually settled on using the index as it is easier for users to type and remember short numeric codes rather than potentially long and complex exam names which are more prone to typographical errors.

##### Allowing Deselection of Exams
We decided to allow users to deselect exams as the exam scores and score statistics are displayed based on the selected exam. Deselecting the exam allows users to get rid of the displayed scores and statistics when they are no longer needed.

##### Extensibility
The design of the exam feature allows for easy extension to accommodate future enhancements or additional functionalities. Methods for managing exams are implemented in the `Model` component, and the updating of UI for Exams is abstracted into the UI component, Making it easy to add new commands or features related to exams.

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div id="score-management"></div>

### **Exam Score Features**

There are 3 main commands that are used to interact with exam scores of each person: `addScore`, `editScore` and `deleteScore`.

<br>

<div id="addscore"></div>

#### **Add Score Command** : `addScore`

The `addScore` command allows users to add a score for an exam to a person displayed in the application.
The user should select the exam they want to add a score for, then specify the index of the person they want to add a score for, and the score they want to add.
The score is then stored in a hashmap named `scores` within the `Person` object in the `Model` component.
This hashmap maps the selected exam (an `Exam` object) to the specified score (a `Score` object).

##### Parsing User Input

The `AddScoreCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the user input to extract the index of the person in the displayed list to add a score to, and the score to add.
It uses the `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize the input string, extracting the `index` and `score`.
It also ensures that the `index` and `score` input value is valid, and that there are no duplicate prefixes in the user input.
The `index` and `score` is then used in instantiating the `AddScoreCommand` by the `AddScoreCommandParser`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the parsing of an `addScore` command with the user input `addScore 1 s|100`:

<p align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/AddScoreParsingSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Sequence Diagram for Parsing of addScore command" />
</p>

> **Note:** <br>
> The parsing of an `editScore` command follows a similar structure, differing in the object instantiated at the end of the `parse` method.
> `EditScoreCommandParser` instantiates an `EditScoreCommand` object.

##### Executing the Command

The `execute` method in `AddScoreCommand` retrieves the `filteredPersons` list in `Model`, and validates the target index against the list of filtered persons to ensure it is not out of bounds.
It then fetches the person to add the score for based on the target index.
It also retrieves the currently selected exam from the `Model`, and validates that the score to be added is not more than the maximum score of the selected exam.
It adds the score to the person's existing `scores` hashmap using the `addExamScoreToPerson` method in the `Model`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the execution of an `addScore` command:

<p align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/AddScoreExecutionSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Sequence Diagram for Parsing of addScore command" />
</p>

> **Note:** <br>
> The execution of an `editScore` command follows a similar structure to the execution of an `addScore` command.

<br>

<div id="editscore"></div>

#### **Edit Score Command** : `editScore`

The `editScore` command allows users to edit a score for an exam of a person displayed in the application.
The user should select the exam they want to edit the score for, then specify the index of the person they want to edit the score for, and the new score they want to edit to.
The updated score is then stored in a hashmap named `scores` within the `Person` object in the `Model` component.
This hashmap maps the selected exam (an `Exam` object) to the updated specified score (a `Score` object).

##### Parsing User Input

The `EditScoreCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the user input to extract the index of the person in the displayed list to edit the score for, and the new score to edit to.
It uses the `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize the input string, extracting the `index` and `score`.
It also ensures that the `index` and `score` input value is valid, and that there are no duplicate prefixes in the user input.
The `index` and `score` is then used in instantiating the `EditScoreCommand` by the `EditScoreCommandParser`.

##### Executing the Command

The `execute` method in `EditScoreCommand` retrieves the `filteredPersons` list in `Model`, and validates the target index against the list of filtered persons to ensure it is not out of bounds.
It then fetches the person to edit the score for based on the target index.
It also retrieves the currently selected exam from the `Model`, and validates that the score to be added is not more than the maximum score of the selected exam.
It updates the score for the selected exam in the person's existing `scores` hashmap using the `addExamScoreToPerson` method in `Model`.

<br>

<div id="deletescore"></div>

#### **Delete Score Command** : `deleteScore`

The `deleteScore` command allows users to delete a score for an exam from a person displayed in the application.
The user should select the exam they want to delete the score for, then specify the index of the person they want to delete the score for.
The key-value pair (exam-score) is removed from the `scores` hashmap within the `Person` object.
This operation removes both the selected exam (key) and the score (value), effectively deleting the score from `Person`.

##### Parsing User Input

The `DeleteScoreCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the user input to extract the index of the person in the displayed list to delete the score for.
It uses the `ParserUtil` to parse the input string, extracting the `index`.
It also ensures that the `index` is valid, and that there are no duplicate prefixes (i.e. there is only one `index` value) in the user input.
The `index` is then used in instantiating the `DeleteScoreCommand` by the `DeleteScoreCommandParser`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the parsing of an `deleteScore` command with the user input `deleteScore 1`:

<p align="center">
    <puml src="diagrams/DeleteScoreParsingSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Sequence Diagram for Parsing of addScore command" />
</p>

##### Executing the Command

The `execute` method in `DeleteScoreCommand` retrieves the `filteredPersons` list in `Model`, and validates the target index against the list of filtered persons to ensure it is not out of bounds.
It then fetches the person to delete the score for based on the target index.
It also retrieves the currently selected exam from the `Model`.
It removes the score for the selected exam in the person's existing `scores` hashmap using the `removeExamScoreFromPerson` method in `Model`.

</p>

<br>

<div id="importexamscores"></div>

#### **Import Exam Scores Command** : `importExamScores`

The `importExamScores` command lets users import exam scores corresponding to existing exams and persons from a CSV file.

##### Parsing User Input

The `ImportExamScoresParser` class is responsible for parsing the user input. It uses the `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize the input string, extracting the file path of the CSV file to be imported.

##### Executing the Command

**Parsing CSV File** <br>

The `ImportExamScoresCommand` class reads the CSV file with the given file path.
The CSV file is parsed with the `OpenCSV` library and a `List<String[]>` is created, with each `String[]` representing a row in the CSV file.

**File Validation** <br>

After parsing, a mapping of `Exam` objects to an inner mapping of an `email` string to a `Double` score is created. This mapping is used to validate the data in the CSV file.
If the **file** is invalid, an error message is returned.

The validation workflow for the **file** is as follows:

<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/ImportExamScoresFileActivityDiagram.puml" alt="Activity Diagram for Import Exam Scores File Validation" /></p>

If the file is valid, any invalid entries will be ignored, with the rest being successfully processed.

A **column** will be ignored if:
1. The column header is not the `email` column, but does not start with `Exam:`.
2. The column header's name does not correspond to an existing `Exam` object. (i.e. Anything after `Exam:` is not an existing exam name.)

A **row** will be ignored if:
1. The `email` value does not correspond to an existing `Person`.

A **cell** will be ignored if:
1. The `Double` representing the score for an existing `Person` and `Exam` is not a valid `Score`.

**Value Validation** <br>

For every valid row:

The `Double` is parsed into a `Score` object.

The `Model` object is then used to:
* Get the `Exam` object corresponding to the exam name in the row;
* Get the `Person` object corresponding to the email in the row;
* And finally add the `Score` object to the correct `Person` for the correct `Exam`.

<br>

##### Concrete Examples of Validation

For concrete examples of the validation process, [refer to the manual testing section of the `importExamScores` command](#importing-exam-scores-importexamscores).


<br>

<div id="scorestatistics"></div>

#### **Score Statistics Command**

The exam statistics feature allows users to view the mean and median scores of the selected exam. The statistics are displayed in the `StatusBarFooter` element of the UI on the right side.

The statistics are automatically updated whenever the selected exam is changed or when there are potential modifications to the scores of the selected exam.

When there are no scores for the selected exam, the statistics are displayed as `No scores available`. When no exam is selected, the statistics are not displayed at all.

##### Storage of Exam Statistics

The `ScoreStatistics` class is used to store the mean and median scores of the selected exam. The `Model` component stores the `ScoreStatistics` object for the currently selected exam as a `SimpleObjectProperty<ScoreStatistics>`.

##### Updating of Exam Statistics

the `ModelManager` class implements a `updateSelectedExamStatistics` and `getSelectedExamStatistics` method to update the statistics.

`updateSelectedExamStatistics` is called whenever the selected exam is changed or when there are potential modifications to the scores of the selected exam (deletion of a Person, adding of Score, etc.). This ensures that the `selectedExamStatistics` object is always kept up-to-date with the scores of the selected exam.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Model` component when the score statistics are updated using the `selectExam` command as an example.

<p align="center"><puml src="diagrams/StatisticsSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Sequence Diagram for Statistics Updating" /></p>

##### User Interface Interaction

The `StatusBarFooter` element of the UI is initialised with an `ObservableValue<ScoreStatistics>` object. This object is bound to the `selectedExamStatistics` object in the `Model` component and is retrieved using the `getSelectedExamStatistics` method.

Whenever a command is executed, the `StatusBarFooter` retrieves the updated statistics and displays them on the right side of the footer which can be seen at the bottom of the UI.

##### Considerations for Exam Statistics Command

**Storage of Exam Statistics** <br>

There were considerations to just avoid the storage of the statistics and calculate them on the fly whenever needed. However, this would have been inefficient as the statistics would have to be recalculated every time the selected exam is changed or when there are potential modifications to the scores of the selected exam. By storing the statistics, we can limit recalculations to only when necessary.

Furthermore, storing the statistics allows us to maintain the code structure of our UI component, which is designed to observe and retrieve data from the `Model` component. If the statistics were to be calculated on the fly, the UI component would have to either calculate the statistics itself or request the `Model` component to calculate the statistics, which would have complicated the code structure by introducing more dependencies between the UI and Model components.

**Using `ScoreStatistics` Class** <br>

The `ScoreStatistics` class was used to store the mean and median scores of the selected exam. This class was chosen as it provides a clean and structured way to store the statistics. The class also provides extensibility, as additional statistics can easily be added in the future by extending the class.

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div id="planned-enhancements"></div>

## **Planned Enhancements**

<br>

#### Enhance Input Validation for `find` Command

Currently, the `find` command only validates the `lt` and `mt` prefixes, where other prefixes are not validated. This means that users may search for persons with fields that do not exist to begin with, which is guaranteed to return no results.

##### Planned Implementation

We plan to enhance the `find` command to validate all prefixes other than `lt` and `mt`. This will ensure that users are not able to search for persons with fields that do not exist in the `Person` object.

However, we need to be careful about overzealous input validation where users may still want to search for fields using incomplete parts of a field, and hence we have to balance these two considerations.

For example, an extreme case will be to search for persons with the `Name` field with `~`, which is disallowed to begin with as `~` is not a valid character for a name. We plan to inform the user outright that the search is invalid and will not return any results.

<br>

#### Update UI to Wrap Text

Currently, the `ResultDisplay` box does not wrap text, which means that long lines of text will extend beyond the width of the box. This results in the need for two scrollbars, a horizontal one for the result box and a vertical one for the currently shown list of persons. This is not ideal as it makes the UI less optimized for the target audience, who prefer using a CLI-optimized application and prefer not to use mouse controls to scroll through scroll boxes.

##### Planned Implementation

We plan to modify the `ResultDisplay` box to wrap text so that there is no longer a need for the horizontal scrollbar in the `ResultDisplay` box.

In the case where the wrapped text still exceeds the height of the `ResultDisplay` box, we plan to enable it to dynamically adjust its height as needed.

<br>

#### Primary Key: Use Both `Matric` and `Email`

Currently, only `Email` is used as a unique identifier for `Person` objects. However, this means that two `Person` objects can have different `Email`s but the same `Matric` number. This clashes with the real-life constraint that NUS students, in particular CS1101S students, are put under, where Matriculation numbers are supposed to be unique for each student. Our planned enhancement hence aims to better reflect real-life constraints.

##### Planned Implementation

Currently, the `hasPerson` method in the `Model` class checks for the existence of a `Person` object based on the `Email` field. We plan to modify this method to check for the existence of a `Person` object based on both the `Email` and `Matric` fields. This will ensure that two `Person` objects cannot have the same `Matric` number.

However, more checking needs to be done to ensure persons cannot have different overall unique identifiers, but the same `Email` or `Matric` field. (E.g. two persons cannot have the same `Email` but different `Matric` numbers.)

Additionally, some persons such as staff members and course instructors may not have a `Matric` field. Hence, careful consideration needs to be made to implement this new method of checking for unique identifiers.

<br>

#### UX: Make Sample Data Tags More Relevant and Helpful to the User

Currently, the sample data tags are not very helpful to the user, having tags like `friends`, `neighbours` and `family`. This may pose confusion to users about the context of the application, which is the head TA's management of persons related to CS1101S.

##### Planned Implementation

Remove all `Tag` objects that are in the sample data that border on irrelevancy. This can be done by modifying the `SampleDataUtil` class to not add these tags to the sample data.

Retain all other relevant `Tag` objects like `colleagues` and `student` to better reflect the context of the application.

## **Appendix**

<div id="appendix_a"></div>

### Appendix A: Product Scope

**Target user profile**:

* Name: Sarah Johnson
* Age: 23
* Occupation: Head Tutor for CS1101S

* Head tutor for CS1101S course
* Has a need to manage various aspects of course administration
* Has a need to schedule classes
* Has a need to coordinate with teaching assistants
* Has a need to effectively communicate with students
* Has a need to manage a significant number of persons
* Prefer desktop apps over other types
* Can type fast
* Prefers typing to mouse interactions
* Is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:

* Manage persons faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app
* Centralised platform to store and manage person details for all relevant individuals involved in course administration
* Able to store and manage exam scores for all students in the course
* Easier access to information through organising relevant persons into different subgroups
* Able to set up the application through different data-loading options
* Able to assist with management of large scale communication

**Problem scope**:

* The CS1101S Head Tutor will face challenges in effectively organising and managing contact information within the department due to the large scale the course has to operate on. Existing methods, such as paper-based lists or basic digital spreadsheets, lack the necessary functionality to efficiently handle the diverse needs of proper contact management. There is a need for a user-friendly and offline-capable address book solution tailored specifically to the needs of a single user. This address book system should provide features such as easy contact entry and editing, quick search functionality, customizable categorization options, and the ability to add notes for each contact. Additionally, it should operate offline without requiring an internet connection and should not rely on complex database management systems.
* While Avengers Assemble will greatly improve contact management and organisation for the CS1101S Head Tutor, it will not address broader departmental communication or collaboration needs beyond individual contact management since the application is designed to be a single-user system. It will not facilitate communication between users or provide collaboration tools for group projects or tasks. Additionally, the address book system will not handle complex data analysis or reporting functions beyond basic contact information management. Finally, while the system will provide offline functionality, it will not offer real-time synchronisation with online databases or cloud storage solutions.

### Appendix G: Effort

This section aims to showcase the effort put into Avengers Assemble by our team.
We will highlight the difficulty level, challenges faced, and effort required in this project.

<br>

#### Difficulty Level

On top of the `Person` entity originally implemented by AB3, Avengers Assemble also incorporates an additional entity of
`Exam`, with `Score` serving as a connection between the two entities.
With this additional entity added, considerations had to be made regarding the implementation of
different features, interactions between each entity, and the management and storage of these
entities. The consideration of these factors turned out to be more challenging than initially anticipated.

Moreover, in addition to enhancing the original features of AB3 to cater to our target users, Avengers Assemble also introduces
many new commands to improve the usability of our application, as well as to handle the diverse behaviours and interactions
of `Person` and `Exam`. This required a significant amount of effort to ensure that the new features were
implemented correctly and seamlessly integrated with the existing features.

Compared to the individual project, the group project was lower in intensity for each of us in terms of lines of code,
but the coordination and communication required to ensure that the features were implemented correctly and
seamlessly integrated with the existing features added a layer of complexity to the project.

<br>

#### Effort Required

##### Enhancements to Existing Features

**Addition of New Fields to Persons**<br>
New fields such as recitation, studio, matriculation number, was added to persons to align with the context of our application.

**Find**<br>
Our team improved on the existing `find` command of AB3 to allow for more flexibility. With the new improvements, users
can now find not only based on the name field of persons, but also specify their search based on other fields such as
`email` and `recitation`. With the addition of the exam score features, we also adapted our `find` command to allow users
to filter out persons less than or more than a specified score, revamping the way `find` is used and handled.

**Automatic Tagging of Persons**<br>
In the context of our application, it is mainly used to store students', instructors' and teaching assistants' contacts.
Hence, on top of the original behaviour of the tag feature, we adapted it to automatically tag contacts with a
matriculation number as students.

**User Interface**<br>
Enhancements were made to the user interface to improve the user experience. The structure of the user interface was
modified to accommodate the new features, and the theme of the application was changed to follow the theme of the
course that we were developing the application for. Furthermore, the logic for the updating of user interface was also
modified to a more developer-friendly approach which would allow developers to understand and modify the user interface
more easily.

##### New Features

**Copy**<br>
Our team introduced a new copy command which allows for users to copy the email addresses of the currently displayed persons.
This is to cater to the context of our application, assisting head tutors with the task of making mass announcements.

**Import and Export**<br>
To facilitate the handling and managing of large amounts of information, our group introduced the import and export feature to
allow for flexible data movement externally and internally. These features required extensive effort due to how bug prone
they were. This is elaborated upon in the challenges section below.

**Exams and Exams Scores**<br>
The implementation of the exam and exam score features was the most significant addition to our application, requiring adjustments to existing features and the
introduction of many new commands to handle and manage the addition of exams and exam features. This feature was the most
complex and required the most effort to implement, as it involved the introduction of a new entity, `Exam`, and the management
of scores for each person for each exam. This is further elaborated upon in the challenges section below.

<br>

#### Challenges Faced

##### Understanding the Existing Codebase
One of the challenges we faced was understanding the existing codebase of AB3. We had to familiarize ourselves with the
structure of the codebase, the interactions between the different classes, and the existing features of AB3. This required
us to spend time reading through the code, discussing the existing features, and identifying potential areas where
conflicts might arise when adding new features. We also had to consider how to integrate our new features using the existing
structure in AB3, and how to ensure that the new features did not conflict with the existing features.

##### Considerations for New Entity `Exam` and its Interactions with `Person`
Our team wanted to implement a feature that would allow users to manage and store exam scores for each person.
It was clear from the start that this would require the introduction of a new entity, `Exam`, to store information about
each exam. However, we found that there was a challenge in determining how to connect the `Person` entity with the `Exam` entity, and how to
manage and store the scores for each person for each exam. This required careful consideration and planning to ensure that
the interactions between the two entities were seamless and intuitive for users. We also had to consider how to handle the
storage of these entities and how to manage the data effectively.

**Limited User Interface Space for Score Interaction** <br>

One of the greatest challenges was designing a user-friendly interface for score
interaction within the limited screen space. We had to devise intuitive methods for users to view, input and manage the scores
of various exams, without overwhelming the interface. This proved to be a greater challenge than initially anticipated,
as we had to consider trade-offs between functionality and user experience. Lowering the complexity of the interface
would result in an interface that is easier to read, but might not provide all the necessary information at a glance and
require more user interactions to access the information. On the other hand, a more complex interface would provide more
information at a glance, but might overwhelm users with too much information. Striking a balance between these two
trade-offs was a challenge that required extended discussions and iterations before arriving at a solution that we were
satisfied with: the selection system for exams.

**Implementation of Exam and Exam Score Features** <br>

After coming to a consensus in regard to the user interface, implementation for exam features seemed straightforward.
However, it turned out to be a lot more complex to implement than initially anticipated. Our exam features consisted
of many sub-features which included the management of exams, the management of scores, the storage of scores in persons,
and the importing of scores. As we were working in a collaborative environment, we had to consider how to distribute
the workload in a manner that would prevent conflicts.
This required early discussions of the structure of the exam and score features, and how they would interact with the existing features of AB3.
We drafted up diagrams to visualize the interactions between each feature. This helped us to identify potential conflicts
early on and resolve them through distributing the workload effectively and meeting regularly to discuss progress and issues.

**Data Management for Exams and Scores** <br>

Handling the data for exams and scores was another challenge that we faced. We had to consider how to store the data for
each exam, how to store the scores for each person for each exam, and how to manage the data effectively.
The storage for exams was relatively straightforward, as we could create an additional list in the `AddressBook` class to store
the exams. However, the storage for scores was more complex. We had to decide whether to store all the exam score data
in corresponding `Exam` objects, or store each persons' exam scores in their corresponding `Person` objects.

There was once again another trade-off to consider: storing all exam score data in the `Exam` objects would make it
easier to implement exam operations, but would require more complex interactions between the score and person objects.
On the other hand, storing each person's score in their corresponding `Person` object would make it easier to implement
operations on persons, but would require more complex interactions for exam management. We had to consider the pros and cons
of each approach, before deciding on the latter approach, as we concluded that our application was more person-centric.

##### Bug Fixing and Testing
A significant challenge we faced was the identification and resolution of bugs. Unit tests for our own features were
relatively straightforward to implement, but we found that identifying edge cases proved to be tricky. Certain features
were also a lot more bug prone than others, such as the import features, which required extensive testing to ensure that
all potential errors were caught and proper error messages were displayed. We also had to ensure that the application
handled these errors gracefully and did not crash when these errors occurred.

<br>

#### Achievements
Overall, our group successfully implemented the planned features while addressing bugs and managing potential feature flaws.
Despite initial hesitations about implementing significant new features like exams and exam scores, we overcame the challenge and achieved our goals.
